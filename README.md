# Claude AI Engineer — Evaluation and Observability

Source-of-truth repository for the project modules in the **Claude AI Engineer: Evaluation and Observability** course (`cd15552`). The course is about building Claude-powered extraction and investigation pipelines you can *trust* — schemas that distinguish "the document said so" from "the document was silent," retry loops that tell recoverable failures from futile ones, independent review passes, deterministic human-in-the-loop routing, and resilient multi-source synthesis.

Each top-level folder is a self-contained project module built across a sequence of cumulative, test-driven exercises. Every exercise ships a `starter/` you fill in (marked with `# TODO:`) and a `solution/` reference, with acceptance criteria pinned down by a pytest suite. Each exercise's `starter/` is the previous exercise's `solution/`, so nothing resets — by the final exercise you have the complete working system.

## Projects

### [Build a Resilient Mortgage Document Extraction System](Build%20a%20Resilient%20Mortgage%20Document%20Extraction%20System/)

You are the senior AI engineer at Meridian Home Lending. Build a mortgage-document extractor whose JSON Schema encodes what underwriting can trust: nullable unions, enum-plus-`other` spillover, and per-document-type `required` lists. Then orchestrate a two-pass classify-then-extract flow with forced `tool_choice`, write the extractor system prompt, and validate mathematical consistency across the extracted fields.

- `01-design-resilient-extraction-schema/` — Design the resilient extraction JSON Schema and tools (`pytest tests/test_us01_schema.py`).
- `02-orchestrate-two-pass-tool-choice/` — Classify-then-extract pipeline with forced `tool_choice` (`pytest tests/test_us02_pipeline.py`).
- `03-write-extractor-system-prompt/` — Author the extractor system prompt (`pytest tests/test_us03_prompts.py`).
- `04-validate-mathematical-consistency/` — Cross-field mathematical consistency validation (`pytest tests/test_us04_validator.py`).

### [Build a Validated, Routed Insurance Policy Extraction Pipeline](Build%20a%20Validated,%20Routed%20Insurance%20Policy%20Extraction%20Pipeline/)

Ingest insurance policy renewal documents, validate them, and route each to auto-approve or human review. Build a retry loop that distinguishes recoverable (`format` / `consistency`) failures from irrecoverable (`missing_source`) ones, add SLA-driven batch submission, an independent reviewer with a within-policy integration pass, and deterministic HITL routing with stratified sampling and calibration.

- `01-retry-with-error-feedback/` — Retry with error feedback and futile-retry escalation (`pytest tests/test_us01_retry.py`).
- `02-batch-and-sla/` — Batch processing with SLA-driven submission frequency (`pytest tests/test_us02_batch.py`).
- `03-independent-review/` — Independent reviewer and within-policy integration pass (`pytest tests/test_us03_review.py`).
- `04-hitl-routing/` — Deterministic HITL routing with stratified sampling and calibration (`pytest tests/`).

### [Investigate Supply Chain Risk with Multi-Source Synthesis](Investigate%20Supply%20Chain%20Risk%20with%20Multi-Source%20Synthesis/)

Build a supply-chain risk investigator over the Meridian source corpus: one `Claim` shape for every source, four source readers, a shared vector store, and a synthesis briefing that stays honest about what the sources do and don't support. Then make the coordinator resilient to a source going dark mid-run via a timeout path.

- `01-claim-readers/` — The `Claim` model and the four source readers (`pytest tests/test_readers.py`).
- `02-memory-briefing/` — Shared vector store and synthesis briefing (`pytest tests/test_memory.py tests/test_synthesis.py`).
- `03-resilient-coordinator/` — Timeout path and resilient coordinator (`pytest tests/`).

## Folder layout

Every exercise pairs starter code with a solution, and each side carries its own `README.md`:

```bash
<project>/
└── <NN-exercise-name>/        # numbered, cumulative exercise step
    ├── starter/               # self-contained Python package with TODO blocks to fill in
    │   ├── README.md          # exercise instructions, requirements, verify command
    │   ├── pyproject.toml
    │   ├── <package>/         # the source you complete
    │   ├── fixtures/ or data/ # offline document corpus + recorded API responses
    │   └── tests/             # acceptance tests for this exercise
    └── solution/              # byte-identical to the next exercise's starter, fully implemented
```

## Running an exercise

Each exercise's `README.md` is authoritative, but every project follows the same shape. From a `starter/` (or `solution/`) directory, create a virtual environment, install in editable mode with dev extras, then run the scoped verify command from that exercise's README:

```bash
cd "<project>/<exercise>/starter"
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/pytest tests/test_us01_...py   # use the scoped path from the exercise README
```

Run the scoped test path named in the exercise README, not a bare `pytest`. Each `solution/` folder is byte-identical to the *next* exercise's `starter/`, so it already contains the next exercise's test file and its unimplemented `# TODO:` stubs. A bare `pytest` runs those too and reports failures that belong to the next exercise, not the current one. The scoped path runs only the current exercise's tests.

The starter suite fails until the `# TODO:` blocks are resolved; the exercise is complete when its verify command passes cleanly.

**Offline by default.** The document corpora (`fixtures/` / `data/`) and recorded Anthropic responses ship with every stage, so tests and the CLIs run offline with no API key. Tests marked `@pytest.mark.live` need a real `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and are intentionally outside the verify gate. The Supply Chain project downloads a local embedding model (~90 MB) on first run, then caches it.
