"""Independent review + within-policy integration pass.

Two separate concerns share this module because both are "second-pass" QA steps:
  1. independent_review() — a separate Claude call with no extractor context, returning
     per-field agree/disagree + review_confidence.
  2. integration_pass() — pure cross-field consistency checks within one extraction.

The output of both feeds the routing layer.
